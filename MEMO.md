# Coding Exercise Progress

## Project Initial Setup

> I have set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript integration. I have also configured Tailwind CSS for simple styling. I have defined a folder structure for App routing using Next 14. Additionally, I have added Prettier plugins and set up Husky hooks as well as github worklows to ensure that code is properly formatted and meets certain criteria before being pushed to the main branch. The CI/CD is completed with deployments on vercel with every merge to main branch.

- [x] Initialized project with Next.js
- [x] Configured project to use TypeScript
- [x] Integrated Tailwind CSS (CSS modules it's also an option but for simplicity I choose Tailwind)
- [x] Defined folder structure for App routing (Introduced in Next 13)
- [x] Add prettier plugins
- [x] Add husky hooks and main branch protection

## Testing

> I have configured testing for the project using jest and react testing library. I have performed an initial test to ensure that all functionality is working as expected. Additionally, I have ensured that testing is in place for each component, as well as for the main functions of the application. For a more complex application an e2e test with cypress would be an interesting feature.

- [x] Configure test
- [x] Do a initial test to ensure functionality
- [x] Ensure testing for each component
- [x] Ensure testing for main functions

## Component

> I have defined the component structure and logic for the project. I have implemented a custom handler for the knob component and created a container for the slider component and a visual guide. I have also added functionality for displaying limits and current prices using num inputs. Additionally, I have adapted the page router layout and structure for exercise 1 and 2. I have modified the component to accept ranged or non-ranged lists and created a function to find the closest relative with a time complexity of Olog(n).

- [x] Define component structure and logic
- [x] Knob - custom handler
- [x] Slider - knobs container and visual guide
- [x] Num inputs - display limits and current prices
- [x] Adapt page router layout and structure for exercise 1 and 2
- [x] Modify the component to add functionality for accepting ranged or not lists
- [x] Create a function to find the closest relative inside a range complexity Olog(n) if possible
- [x] Update functionality

### Conclusion

> It has proved to be a challenging but interesting exercise that I enjoyed coding. I tried to deliver clean and understandable code that would be easy for other developers to continue implementing. I have to admit that I'll have a bigger respect for range slide components from now on. Thanks for your time.
